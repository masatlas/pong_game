Pong Game - README

Introduction:
This is a simple console-based Pong game implemented in C++. The game allows two players to control paddles and hit the ball back and forth, aiming to score points against each other.

How to Play:
1. Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system.
2. Open a text editor and copy the C++ code from `pong_game.cpp`.
3. Save the file with the extension `.cpp`, for example, `pong_game.cpp`.
4. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved `pong_game.cpp`.
5. Compile the code using your C++ compiler. For example, if you are using g++, you can compile it with the following command:
   g++ pong_game.cpp -o pong_game
6. Once the compilation is successful, you will have an executable file (pong_game.exe on Windows or pong_game on Linux/macOS).
7. Run the game by typing the name of the executable and pressing Enter.
8. Two paddles will be displayed on the left and right sides of the console. The ball will move back and forth between the paddles.
9. Player 1 (left paddle) can control the paddle with 'w' (up) and 's' (down) keys.
10. Player 2 (right paddle) can control the paddle with 'up arrow' (up) and 'down arrow' (down) keys.
11. The ball will bounce off the top and bottom walls and the paddles.
12. Score points by hitting the ball past your opponent's paddle.
13. The game continues until you decide to exit by pressing 'x'.
14. Have fun playing Pong!

Customization:
This is a basic implementation, and you can customize and enhance the game further to suit your preferences. Some ideas for improvements include:
- Implementing score tracking for both players.
- Adding speed variations to the ball as the game progresses.
- Enhancing collision detection for more realistic gameplay.
- Creating graphical elements and improving the visual appearance.
- Implementing a winning condition (e.g., the first player to reach a certain score wins).
- Adding sound effects or music to make the game more engaging.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to add your own creative touches to the Pong game!

Have fun and happy coding!
